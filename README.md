# Web UI test automation framework for AXAXL

## Project Overview
This project is a web UI test automation framework designed for AXAXL. It provides a structured approach to automate testing of web applications, ensuring reliability and efficiency in the testing process.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: The framework is built with a modular architecture, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports multiple browsers to ensure compatibility across different environments.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Enables testing with various data sets to validate application behavior under different conditions.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed test reports to track test execution and results using Allure Reports.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.
- **Extensible**: Allows for custom extensions and plugins to enhance functionality.
- **Support for Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements the POM design pattern for better organization of test code.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed (version 3.7 or higher).
- **Playwright**: Ensure Playwright is installed in your environment.
- **Allure**: Install Allure for reporting purposes.
- **pytest**: Use pytest as the test runner.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd axaxl_webui_automation
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

### Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
pytest --alluredir=reports/allure-results
```

### Generating Allure Reports
To generate temporary Allure reports, run:
```bash
allure serve allure-results
```

To generate static Allure reports, run:
```bash
allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean
```
then
```bash
allure open allure-report
```
